# Next Steps - Multi-Participant Chat System

## Immediate Task
Run integration tests against the real server to verify all endpoints work correctly.

## Steps to Execute

1. **Start the server** (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rvguha/code/conv/code/python
   python -m webserver.aiohttp_server
   ```

2. **Run integration tests** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rvguha/code/conv
   python -m pytest tests/integration/test_rest_api.py -xvs
   ```

3. **Monitor server logs** for any errors during test execution

## Expected Results
- All chat endpoints should respond correctly:
  - POST `/chat/create` - 201 Created
  - GET `/chat/my-conversations` - 200 OK
  - GET `/chat/conversations/{id}` - 200 OK
  - POST `/chat/{id}/join` - 200 OK
  - DELETE `/chat/{id}/leave` - 200 OK
  - GET `/health/chat` - 200 OK

## If Tests Fail
1. Check server logs for specific error messages
2. Verify payload format matches server expectations
3. Ensure auth middleware is properly configured
4. Check that all required fields are present in requests

## After Tests Pass
1. Run full test suite: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
2. Document any remaining issues
3. Create pull request with implementation

## Technical Details
- Server expects `user_id` and `name` fields (not `participantId`/`displayName`)
- Auth middleware sets `user.id = "authenticated_user"` for valid tokens
- Conversations require at least one participant
- The requesting user must be included in participants list
