# Next Steps

## ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE: Integration Tests 100% Passing!
- **REST API Tests**: 15/15 passing ✅
- **WebSocket Tests**: 16/16 passing ✅
- All validation fixed, proper error codes, WebSocket protocol correct

## Immediate Priority: Fix Participant Storage Issue

The E2E tests (4/7 passing) are failing because `conversation.active_participants` contains strings instead of ParticipantInfo objects in some cases.

### Current Investigation Status
- Storage layer works correctly ✅
- Conversation creation works correctly ✅
- Issue is somewhere between creation and retrieval

### Next Debugging Steps

1. **Check if ConversationManager is modifying participants**:
```bash
grep -n "active_participants.*=" code/python/chat/conversation.py
grep -n "participants.*str" code/python/chat/conversation.py
```

2. **Check if there's a serialization issue**:
```bash
# Look for JSON serialization that might convert objects to strings
grep -n "json.dumps.*participant" code/python/
grep -n "str(.*participant" code/python/
```

3. **Add more debug logging**:
- In create_conversation handler after storage
- In get_conversation handler before accessing participants
- In join/leave handlers

4. **Check conversation manager's participant tracking**:
The ConversationManager might be maintaining its own participant list that conflicts with the Conversation object's list.

## How to Resume Next Session

### 1. Start with focused debugging:
```bash
# Run single failing test with debug output
python scripts/run_tests_with_server.py --keep-server &
sleep 5
python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_multi_participant_real.py::TestSingleUserConversationFlow::test_create_send_receive_conversation_cycle -xvs
```

### 2. Check server logs for the exact error location:
Look for the traceback after "Error getting conversation" to find the exact line where strings are being stored.

### 3. Likely fixes:
1. ConversationManager might be overwriting participants with strings
2. There might be a race condition between storage and manager updates
3. WebSocket handler might be modifying conversation state incorrectly

### 4. After fixing participant issue:
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
python scripts/run_tests_with_server.py e2e

# Then run full suite
python scripts/run_tests_with_server.py
```

## Success Criteria
- All 7 E2E tests passing
- Full test suite (249 tests) passing
- No string objects in active_participants sets

## Key Files to Debug
1. `/code/python/chat/conversation.py` - Check ConversationManager participant handling
2. `/code/python/webserver/routes/chat.py` - Add debug logging
3. `/code/python/chat/websocket.py` - Check if modifying participants
4. `/code/python/chat_storage_providers/memory_storage.py` - Already verified working

## Current Test Status
- Integration: 31/31 ✅ (100%)
- E2E: 4/7 (57%)
- Total: 35/38 (92%)

Almost there! Just need to fix the participant storage issue.
