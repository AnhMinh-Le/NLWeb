# Next Steps for Frontend Chat Client Implementation

## Current Status
All frontend phases complete including API Service and State Manager. Frontend is fully integrated and ready.

## Completed in this session:
- ✓ WebSocket service with reconnection
- ✓ All UI components (Sidebar, Chat, Share, Site Selector)
- ✓ Site selector with mode selection
- ✓ Main app integration and event wiring
- ✓ Complete message flow with sanitization
- ✓ Secure renderer for XSS protection
- ✓ Responsive CSS with dark mode
- ✓ Test harness with MockWebSocket
- ✓ Integration test scenarios
- ✓ API Service with retry logic and auth
- ✓ State Manager with localStorage persistence
- ✓ Full integration of all services and UI components

## Immediate Next Tasks (In Order):

### 1. Download Dependencies ✓ NEXT PRIORITY
- Download DOMPurify.js to /static/
- Copy existing renderer files from current chat implementation

## Backend Tasks (Separate)
- [ ] Complete reliability tests
- [ ] Fix storage provider implementations
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Integration testing

## Resume Instructions

To resume development:

1. **Check test status**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rvguha/code/conv/code/python
   python -m pytest tests/test_chat_performance.py -v
   python -m pytest tests/test_chat_security.py -v
   ```

2. **Continue with reliability tests**:
   ```bash
   # Create test_chat_reliability.py
   # Focus on network interruption and reconnection scenarios
   ```

3. **Fix any failing tests**:
   - Most likely issues: missing imports, storage method implementations
   - Check conversation access control in WebSocket handler

4. **Key files to reference**:
   - `/Users/rvguha/code/conv/code/python/chat/` - Core chat implementation
   - `/Users/rvguha/code/conv/code/python/webserver/routes/chat.py` - API endpoints
   - `/Users/rvguha/code/conv/code/python/tests/test_chat_*.py` - Test suites

5. **Architecture reminders**:
   - WebSocket per human, messages broadcast to all
   - ConversationManager is the central orchestrator
   - At-least-once delivery with async persistence
   - Mode switching: SINGLE (100ms) vs MULTI (2000ms)
