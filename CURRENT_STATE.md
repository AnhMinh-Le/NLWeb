# Current State

## Active Branch
`conversation-api-implementation`

## Current Work
Implementing conversation API endpoints and storage functionality for the NLWeb system.

## Completed Today
- Created comprehensive architecture documentation:
  - `SIMPLE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Component design
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` - 5-phase plan
  - `MCP_INTEGRATION.md` - Current MCP behavior analysis
  - `STORAGE_ANALYSIS.md` - Retrieval patterns for chat
  - `SECURITY_PLAN.md` - Auth, encryption, PII handling
- Implemented chat data models (TDD):
  - `chat/schemas.py` - ChatMessage, Conversation, ParticipantInfo
  - Support for multiple human participants
  - Server-assigned sequence IDs for message ordering
  - Queue overflow handling
- Implemented chat storage system:
  - `chat/storage.py` - Interface and client with routing
  - `chat/cache.py` - Thread-safe in-memory cache
  - `chat_storage_providers/memory_storage.py` - Memory backend
  - `chat/metrics.py` - Performance and usage metrics
  - Atomic sequence ID generation for concurrent messages
  - Full test coverage (21 tests passing)

## System Status
- Backend: Python aiohttp server
- Frontend: JavaScript with ES6 modules
- Authentication: OAuth support (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, GitHub)
- Search modes: List, summarize, generate
- Streaming: Real-time response support
- Chat: Data models and storage layer ready

## Known Issues
- Generate mode bug (fixed) - was caused by merge conflicts in fp-chat-interface.js
- The nlws message handler properly renders AI-generated responses

## Recently Completed
- Implemented WebSocket infrastructure:
  - `chat/websocket.py` - WebSocket manager and connection handling
  - Support for multiple humans per conversation
  - Connection heartbeat with ping/pong
  - Participant limit enforcement
  - Exponential backoff reconnection (1s, 2s, 4s... max 30s)
  - O(N) message broadcasting
  - Queue size checking before accepting messages
  - Full test coverage (20 tests passing)
- Created client-side reconnection example:
  - `static/websocket-client.js` - JavaScript WebSocket client
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Message queuing during disconnection
  - Connection state management
- Implemented NLWeb integration:
  - `chat/participants.py` - NLWebParticipant and context builder
  - Wraps existing NLWebHandler WITHOUT modification
  - Processes every message from any human
  - Builds context with last N messages from ALL humans
  - Preserves sender_id to identify message origin
  - Configurable timeout and context size
  - Handles streaming responses
  - Full test coverage (15 tests passing)
- Implemented conversation orchestration:
  - `chat/conversation.py` - ConversationManager for message routing
  - Routes messages to ALL participants except sender
  - Tracks active WebSocket connections per participant
  - Assigns unique sequence IDs atomically
  - Delivers immediately then persists asynchronously
  - Smart input modes: single (100ms) vs multi (2000ms)
  - Queue management with ability to drop old NLWeb jobs
  - Full test coverage (14 tests passing)
- Implemented Chat API endpoints:
  - `webserver/routes/chat.py` - RESTful API for chat system
  - POST `/chat/create` - Create multi-participant conversations
  - GET `/chat/my-conversations` - List user's conversations
  - GET `/chat/ws/{conv_id}` - WebSocket upgrade for real-time chat
  - GET `/health/chat` - Comprehensive health check endpoint
  - Integrated authentication middleware
  - Added chat system initialization in server startup
- Created comprehensive verification tests:
  - `tests/test_chat_performance.py` - Performance benchmarks
    - Single user latency vs /ask endpoint
    - Multi-human scenarios (2-5 participants)
    - WebSocket overhead measurement
    - Queue limit behavior
    - Broadcast timing with 10+ participants
  - `tests/test_chat_security.py` - Security audit tests
    - WSS encryption verification
    - Auth token validation
    - Message sanitization
    - PII redaction infrastructure
    - Access control verification

## TODAY'S PROGRESS - Integration Test Fixes

### Implemented Missing Endpoints
- **POST `/chat/{id}/join`** - Join existing conversation with duplicate checking
- **DELETE `/chat/{id}/leave`** - Leave conversation with proper cleanup
- **GET `/chat/conversations/{id}`** - Get full conversation details
- All endpoints integrated with storage and WebSocket broadcasting

### Fixed Test Infrastructure
- **Removed mock-based testing** - No more aioresponses
- **Updated to use real server** - Tests hit localhost:8000
- **Fixed payload format** to match server expectations:
  - `participantId` → `user_id`
  - `displayName` → `name`
  - Removed `type` field
  - Added `enable_ai` field
  - Use `authenticated_user` as user_id (matches auth middleware)

### Current Status
- **249 total tests** identified in test suite
- **54 integration tests** completely rewritten
- **Server configuration** debugged (was in wrong directory)
- **Ready to run** once server is started

## System Status
- Chat system infrastructure complete
- WebSocket + REST API ready
- Performance and security test suites created
- Integration tests updated and ready to run

## Next Steps
- Run integration tests against real server
- Fix any remaining test failures
- Run full test suite (249 tests)
- Address any system issues found
