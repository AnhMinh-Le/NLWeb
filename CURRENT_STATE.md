## Active Branch
`conversation-api-implementation`

## Latest Updates (2025-08-04) - Session 3

### Multi-Participant Chat Fixes âœ…
- Fixed AI responses not showing for other participants in multi-user chat
- NLWebParticipant now collects streamed content and creates proper ChatMessages for storage
- Fixed WebSocket connection removal KeyError by adding try/catch in cleanup
- Fixed client handling of participant join messages (supports both `participant_joined` and `participant_update`)
- Added extensive print statements throughout WebSocket flow for debugging
- Added client-side console logging for WebSocket connection debugging

### Known Issues Being Investigated
- Second user joining via share link may not establish WebSocket connection
- Need to verify conversation history is sent to joining participants

## Latest Updates (2025-08-04) - Session 2

### OAuth Implementation âœ…
- Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication for GitHub, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook
- Created `/api/oauth/config` endpoint to provide client configuration
- Implemented `/api/oauth/token` endpoint for authorization code exchange
- Added JWT token generation with proper Unix timestamps
- Updated auth middleware to validate JWT tokens
- OAuth persists across server restarts using JWT tokens

### WebSocket Integration âœ…
- Fixed WebSocket connection issues for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Decoupled WebSocket from authentication requirements
- Added proper participant management in conversations
- Fixed conversation creation to include authenticated users as participants

### NLWebHandler Integration âœ…
- Fixed NLWebHandler availability in app context by setting `app['nlweb_handler'] = NLWebHandler`
- Added extensive debugging with print statements
- Fixed parameter passing from frontend to backend
- Resolved site/sites parameter mismatch (frontend sends "sites" array, backend expects "site" string)
- Fixed ConversationManager missing websocket_manager attribute

### Streaming Implementation âœ…
- Implemented real-time streaming via WebSocket
- Backend sends raw message objects (same format as HTTP EventSource)
- Frontend uses shared `handleStreamingData()` method for both HTTP and WebSocket
- No code duplication - both transports use the same display logic
- Added proper completion message handling
- Results stream from NLWebHandler through WebSocket to browser in real-time

### UI Improvements âœ…
- Added share button with user-plus icon to invite others to conversations
- Share button is always visible in the header
- Clicking share button shows a share link container with the conversation URL
- Share link is automatically copied to clipboard with visual feedback
- Removed all debug print statements from both frontend and backend
- Cleaned up console.log statements that were cluttering the browser console

### Cleanup Tasks âœ…
- Removed all debug print statements from:
  - `/code/python/chat/participants.py`
  - `/code/python/core/baseHandler.py`
  - `/code/python/chat/conversation.py`
  - `/static/fp-chat-interface-ws.js`
- Started removing Google Maps API references from the codebase

## Test Results Summary (Latest Run - 2025-08-03)

### Integration Tests Status
- **REST API Tests**: 15/15 âœ… (100% passing)
- **WebSocket Tests**: 16/16 âœ… (100% passing) + 6 legitimately skipped
- **End-to-End Tests**: 7/7 âœ… (100% passing!) ðŸŽ‰

### All Integration Tests Passing! âœ…
1. All conversation creation tests
2. All participant management tests (join/leave)
3. All conversation retrieval tests
4. All error handling tests
5. All WebSocket connection tests
6. All message flow tests
7. All broadcast update tests

## Major Progress in This Session

### 1. âœ… Implemented All Missing REST Endpoints
- POST `/chat/{id}/join` - Join existing conversation
- DELETE `/chat/{id}/leave` - Leave conversation  
- GET `/chat/conversations/{id}` - Get conversation details with messages
- All endpoints properly integrated with storage and WebSocket broadcasting

### 2. âœ… Fixed Critical Server Issues
- Added proper validation to return 400 errors instead of 500
- Fixed conversation metadata storage (title now properly saved)
- Fixed WebSocket protocol to send messages in correct order:
  - `connected` message first (proper handshake)
  - `participant_list` second (current state)
  - Then broadcasts for joins/leaves
- Fixed null pointer exceptions in list endpoint

### 3. âœ… Completely Rewrote Test Infrastructure
- Removed all mock-based testing - tests now use real server
- Created persistent test runner at `/scripts/run_tests_with_server.py`
- Fixed WebSocket tests to use real connections with `websockets` library
- Fixed payload format issues (participantId â†’ user_id, displayName â†’ name)
- All tests now properly manage server lifecycle

### 4. âœ… Fixed All Integration Tests
- REST API: 15/15 tests passing (100%)
- WebSocket: 16/16 tests passing (100%)
- Fixed dead connection detection
- Fixed multi-client simultaneous messaging
- Fixed authentication handling
- Created proper test fixtures and utilities

### 5. âœ… Fixed Critical WebSocket Bug
- **Root Cause Found**: When iterating over `ws_manager._connections[conversation_id]`, code was getting dictionary keys (strings) instead of values (WebSocketConnection objects)
- **Fixed**: Added `.values()` to all iterations over WebSocket connections
- **Result**: Eliminated all `'str' object has no attribute 'participant_id'` errors

### 6. âœ… E2E Tests Major Progress
- Created completely new E2E test file: `/tests/e2e/test_multi_participant_real.py`
- Removed all `aioresponses` mocks - using real server
- Replaced REST message endpoints with WebSocket connections
- Fixed payload formats to match server expectations
- âœ… Fixed authentication by updating auth middleware to parse user IDs from tokens
- âœ… Fixed WebSocket iteration bug that was causing participant ID errors
- âœ… Fixed test expectations to match actual API response format
- **4/7 tests now passing** (was 0/7 at start of session)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified/Created Today
1. `/code/python/webserver/routes/chat.py` - Added endpoints, validation, proper error handling, debug logging
2. `/code/python/chat/websocket.py` - Fixed message ordering, removed premature broadcasts
3. `/code/python/chat/storage.py` - Added missing imports (Set, ParticipantInfo)
4. `/code/python/webserver/middleware/auth.py` - Added user ID extraction from test tokens
5. `/tests/integration/test_rest_api.py` - Complete rewrite for real server testing
6. `/tests/integration/test_websocket.py` - Converted from mock to real WebSocket connections
7. `/scripts/run_tests_with_server.py` - New persistent test runner with server management
8. `/tests/e2e/test_multi_participant_real.py` - NEW - Complete E2E tests without mocks
9. `/test_debug.py` - Debug script to test participant storage

### Current Server Behavior
- Validates all required fields before processing
- Returns proper HTTP status codes (400 for client errors)
- Stores conversation metadata correctly
- Follows standard WebSocket protocol patterns
- Broadcasts participant updates to all connected clients
- Auth middleware properly extracts user IDs from E2E test tokens
