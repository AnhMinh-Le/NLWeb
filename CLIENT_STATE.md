- Added AI response handling with routing by message_type
- Implemented streaming AI response support
- Added typing indicator throttling (3 second minimum)
- All content sanitization handled at UI layer (ChatUI)

## Notes:
- Need to download DOMPurify before testing
- Need to copy existing renderer files
- OAuth tokens will be stored in sessionStorage
- Email identity will be in localStorage
