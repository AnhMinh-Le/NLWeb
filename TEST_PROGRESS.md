- [x] Performance baseline test created (awaiting execution)

## Test Suites Progress

### Unit Tests (7/28)
#### Frontend Components

- [x] ParticipantInfo tests (5 tests)
- [x] Storage interface - sequence ID generation (10 tests)
- [x] Storage interface - message persistence (8 tests)
- [x] Storage interface - retrieval with pagination (4 tests)
- [x] Cache layer - LRU eviction and thread safety (6 tests)
- [ ] ConversationManager - participant management
- [ ] ConversationManager - message routing
- [ ] ConversationManager - queue management
- [ ] NLWebParticipant - context building
- [ ] NLWebParticipant - timeout handling
- [ ] NLWebContextBuilder - message filtering

### Integration Tests (0/15)
- [ ] POST /chat/create endpoint
- [ ] GET /chat/my-conversations endpoint
- [ ] GET /chat/conversations/:id endpoint
- [ ] POST /chat/:id/join endpoint
- [ ] DELETE /chat/:id/leave endpoint
- [ ] WebSocket connection lifecycle
- [ ] WebSocket message flow (client→server→AI→client)
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection with sync
- [ ] Authentication flow (OAuth + email fallback)
- [ ] Rate limiting (429 responses)
- [ ] Queue overflow handling
- [ ] Multi-participant broadcast
- [ ] Participant join/leave notifications
- [ ] Typing indicator propagation
- [ ] Mode switching (SINGLE ↔ MULTI)

### Performance Tests (0/8)
- [ ] Baseline /ask endpoint latency
- [ ] Single participant latency (≤105% of baseline)
- [ ] Multi-participant broadcast timing (<200ms)
- [ ] WebSocket handshake overhead (≤50ms)
- [ ] Message routing performance (≤1ms for 2, ≤5ms for 10)
- [ ] Storage operation latency (<50ms)
- [ ] 1000 concurrent connections
- [ ] 100 messages/second throughput

### Security Tests (0/6)
- [ ] XSS prevention in all rendered content
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] WebSocket auth validation
- [ ] Rate limit enforcement
- [ ] CORS policy validation
- [ ] Session hijacking prevention

### Reliability Tests (0/8)
- [ ] Network interruption recovery
- [ ] At-least-once delivery verification
- [ ] Message deduplication
- [ ] Sequence ID consistency under load
- [ ] Storage failure handling
- [ ] Participant disconnect/reconnect
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Memory leak detection

### End-to-End Tests (0/5)
- [ ] Single user conversation flow
- [ ] Multi-user conversation (3 humans + 1 AI)
- [ ] Large conversation (50+ participants)
- [ ] Share link and join flow
- [ ] Full conversation lifecycle (create→chat→leave)
